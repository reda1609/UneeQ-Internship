# UneeQ Internship

## Overview

This repository contains the projects I completed during my **UneeQ Internship** in the Machine Learning track. Throughout the internship, I worked on five tasks, applying data science and machine learning techniques to real-world problems. Each task involved data exploration, preprocessing, model training and evaluation.

## Projects

### 1. **Customer Churn Prediction**

**Objective**: Predict whether a customer will churn based on given features.

**Dataset**: [Customer Churn Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CfxQPAPqHcvwfR4hkaGcuTCkVQjHx11b/view).

**Steps**:

- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

- Preprocessed the data (handling missing values, encoding categorical features, feature scaling).

- Built and evaluated machine learning classification models.

### 2. **Health Diagnosis Prediction**

**Objective**: Predict health conditions based on input medical data.

**Dataset**: [Healthcare Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u1hwp1Ph5oYsNau8GSWnDFr3fpR77IIi/view).

**Steps**:

- Conducted EDA to understand data distribution and key patterns.

- Applied data preprocessing techniques (handling missing values, feature engineering).

- Trained various machine learning models and evaluated them with relevant metrics (e.g., Recall for handling imbalanced data).

### 3. **Movie Recommendation System**

**Objective**: Build a content-based recommendation system.

**Dataset**: [TMDB Movie Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata).

**Steps**:

- Processed movie descriptions and converted them into vector representations.

- Computed similarities between movies using text vectorization techniques (e.g., TF-IDF, cosine similarity).

- Developed a recommendation system based on content similarity.

### 4. **Handwritten Digit Recognition**

**Objective**: Classify handwritten digits using deep learning models.

**Dataset**: [MNIST dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pIEYL1WYpPauci75WVMO_aRJqMN8BaCV/view).

**Steps**:

- Built a fully connected neural network (FCN).

- Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to improve accuracy.

- Trained and evaluated models using metrics like accuracy and loss.

### 5. **Sentiment Analysis on Social Media Data**

**Objective**: Classify social media comments as positive, neutral, or negative.

**Dataset**: [Sentiment Analysis Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PM2DJX4Mpb9CBi2laPe76OFHa3k7_CiD/view).

**Steps**:

- Performed text preprocessing (removing stopwords, handling missing values, removing duplicates).

- Converted text data into numerical vectors for model training.

- Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).

- Built and evaluated machine learning models for sentiment classification.

## **Technologies Used**

- Programming Language: Python

- Libraries & Tools: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, Optuna, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NLTK, SMOTE
